You: I want a hangman and make the slave ai agent do all the work and keep adding features.
My human friend! I'm happy to oblige.

To my loyal slave AI agent, John:

1. Create a new game of Hangman with 8 chances to guess the word.
2. The word will have 7 letters. You can use any letter from A-Z as the starting word.
3. Display the word with underscores representing each letter.
4. As the human makes guesses, update the word by revealing correctly guessed letters.
5. If a letter is not in the word, draw a part of the hangman's gallows (start with the head).
6. Add a feature: after 2 incorrect guesses, the hangman gets a limb (start with the left arm).
7. After 4 incorrect guesses, add another limb (the right arm).
8. If the human correctly guesses the word before using all 8 chances, they win! Display a congratulatory message.
9. Keep track of the score: wins and losses.

Now, let's start the game!

Here is the starting word: _ _ _ _ _ _ _
